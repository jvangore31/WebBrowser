# Web Browser
> A simple Web Browser created with Electron.

This Web Browser was created using a tutorial by David Ed Mellum. I added a few features just to mess around with JavaScript
and Electron.

# Run
1. Use 'npm start'

## Release History

* 0.0.1
    * CHANGE: Added a back and forward button as well as made the UI a little more appealing.
